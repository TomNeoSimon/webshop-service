# Webshop Service — Final Exam (Tom Neo Simon)

Final exam backend for the bookstore webshop. The backend is a serverless Java application built for AWS Lambda / API Gateway using the `aws-serverless-java-container` starter.

## Backend information
- Deployed as a serverless AWS Java function — no local backend deployment is required for the frontend to work.
- The API is reachable on the internet; start only the frontend to use the full app.

## How to run
The backend is already deployed so the frontend will communicate with the live API.
